# Day_Planner_JQuery

I created an array containing information to be showed and stored in the timeblocks. The array was inside a variable called dayArray. Using the moment.js library a function was created to get the current date and display in the header, so everytime the user opens the page the date will be updated to the current date. Another function was also created (showStorage();) to display any stored data existing in localStorage when the user loads the page, so any data saved by the user will be shown.

Using the forEach method and louping through the array, the timeblock rows and other scheduler visuals were displayed.
